Issues:
- - - -
- featuredProducts component is not as respnsive as it should be. The `add to cart` button phases out for any width less than 450px.

-MUI's makeStyles import is deprecated. We need to consider switching to Systems: https://mui.com/system/basics/.
-featuredProducts's cardMedia is not sized correctly with the current test data.
